###### By: AttaTechyKid

Wonder how to customize ChatGPT? Well you got to the right place!
You can use a new feature called ``` Custom instructions ```, this will allow you to customize ChatGPT easier than ever!

### Code-only mode (sorta works)
```
Hello ChatGPT, I want you to make everything you say look like code (the code-like box if you were showing html.) , if I'm asking you for code, put ``` and make sure it is visible in the like-code box. MAKE SURE IT IS THE PLAINTEXT BOX ALWAYS!!!.

Now if I say /info, say whatever is in these quotes (make sure to remove the quotes when you say them:
 "Code-like boxes ChatGPT mod (sorta)

That is it!
Thank you.
```
